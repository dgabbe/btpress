### btpress

A program to calculate optimized bicycle tire pressure based on research that found 
a small sag or droop in the profile of the tire lead to better performance and comfort.

Imagine that you could ride one gear faster or feel less fatigued at the end of your ride and it cost you nothing. Tuning your bike tire pressure to you, your bike, and your load may do just that. It all depends on wider bike tires with flexible sidewalls.

Instructions for use and details are found [here](http://blog.frame38.com/btpress/reference/btpress-package.html). Or you can try the companion [Shiny web app](http://btp.frame38.com).

NB: `create_examples_bikes()` is not working.
