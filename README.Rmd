Imagine that you could ride one gear faster or feel less fatigued at the end of your ride and it cost you nothing. Tuning your bike tire pressure to you, your bike, and your load may do just that. It all depends on wider bike tires with flexible sidewalls.

This program calculates your optimized bicycle tire pressure based on research
that found a small sag or droop in the profile of the tire lead to better
performance and comfort. An underinflated tire has too much rolling resistance.
An overinflated tire transmits too much vibration to your muscle fibers causing the
 fibers to rub against each, making you inefficient. 

Instructions for use and more details are  [here](http://blog.frame38.com/btpress/reference/btpress-package.html). Or you can try the companion [Shiny web app](http://btp.frame38.com).
