### btpress

A program to calculate optimized bicycle tire pressure based on research that found 
a small sag or droop in the profile of the tire lead to better performance and comfort.

Image that you could ride one gear faster or feel less fatigued at the end of your ride and it cost you nothing. Tuning your bike tire pressue to you, your bike, and your load may do just that. It all depends on wider bike tires with flexible sidewalls.

A more expansive version coming soon... Replace w/pkgdown reference!
