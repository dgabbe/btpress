Imagine that you could ride one gear faster or feel less fatigued at the
end of your ride and it cost you nothing. Tuning your bike tire pressure
to you, your bike, and your load may do just that. It all depends on
wider bike tires with flexible sidewalls.

This program calculates your optimized bicycle tire pressure based on
research that found a small sag or droop in the profile of the tire lead
to better performance and comfort. An underinflated tire has too much
rolling resistance. An overinflated tire transmits too much vibration to
your muscle fibers causing the fibers to rub against each, making you
inefficient.
