#' If you were told that you could bicycle faster and more comfortablely simply
#' by changing your bike tire pressure, would you try it? There are now 2
#' independent studies that support lower pressures are significantly better
#' than pumping up your tires until they are rock hard.  See the References
#' section for links.
#'
#' @section Directions for Use:
#'
#' Extra light casings need an extra 10-15\% pressure to prevent the casing threads from breaking.
#'
#' @section Directions for Updating Tire Sizes:
#'
#' Update \code{a_sizes_loads.R} for new tire sizes and wheel loads and rebuild package.
