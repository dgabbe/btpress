#' If you were told that you could bicycle faster and more comfortablely simply
#' by changing your bike tire pressure, would you try it? There are now 2
#' independent studies that support lower pressures are significantly better
#' than pumping up your tires until they are rock hard.
#' See the References section for articles.
#'
#' @section Pump Inaccuracies:
#'
#' Pump gauges considerably inaccurate. Parallex viewing makes precise reading
#' of needle impossible. Never mind the pressure sensing mechanism has a wide tolerance.
#'
#' @section Rim Widths:
#'
#' The original research was conducted when internal widths for road rims were around 19mm.
#' Today's rims are available in wider sizes, 23 - 25mm, increasing the volume up to 33\%.
#' This program does not use internal rim width in its calculations.
#'
#' @section Weight vs. Load:
#'
#' At the end of the day, these two are effectively the same.  That said,
#' \emph{Weight} is used for the individual components that go into the calculations.
#' \emph{Load} is used
#' to describe the forces the tires are subject to.
#'
#' @section Directions for Use:
#'
#' Extra light casings need an extra 10-15\% pressure to prevent the casing threads
#' from breaking.
#'
#' There are other subtlies which are not explicitly taken into account. The
#' biggest one is weight carried on the rider. For example, if your bike lock is
#' carried on you, it should be added to the rider weight, not the load field.
#' Same for a backpack.  Carrying weight on front and rear racks is not
#' considered by the program.
#'
#' Snow tires and thick sidewalled tires are supported by their sidewalls and do
#' not respond to pressure changes the way performace tires do.
