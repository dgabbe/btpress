#' If you were told that adjusting your bicycle tire pressure
#' would improve your performance and comfort, especially since it is free,
#' you would keep an open mind and try it.  There are now 2 independent studies
#' that support lower pressures are significantly better than pumping up your
#' tires until they are rock hard.  See the References section for links.
#'
#' @section Directions for Use:
#'
#' Extra light casings need an extra 10% pressure to prevent the casing threads from breaking.
#'
#' @section Directions for Updating Tire Sizes
#'
#' Update \code{sizes_loads.R} for new tire sizes and wheel loads and rebuild package.
