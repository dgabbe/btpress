    <p>A program to calculate optimized bicycle tire pressure based on research that
found a small sag or droop in the profile of the tire lead to better
performance and comfort.</p>
    

        
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>Image that you could ride one gear faster or feel less fatigued at the end of
your ride and it cost you nothing. Tuning your bike tire pressue to you, your
bike, and your load may do just that. It all depends on wider bike tires with
flexible sidewalls.</p>
    <p>Riding one gear higher, depending on your gearing, is a 5 - 8% increase.
There are now 2 independent studies that support lower pressures are
significantly better than pumping up your tires until they are rock hard. See
the References section for articles.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="directions-for-use"><a class="anchor" href="#directions-for-use"></a>Directions for Use</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>The first step is evaluating whether your tires have flexible sidewalls
which will respond readily to tire pressure changes. Tires marketed as
racing tires, marketed as having a casing from a tubular tire, used by
professional racers, or are a folding tire are good candidates. On the
other hand, puncture resistant tires,
<a href = 'https://edsasslercoaching.com/product-reviews/nokian-a10-studded-winter-tires/'>snow tires</a>,
and thick sidewalled tires are supported by their sidewalls and do not
respond to pressure changes very well.</p>
    <p>The simplest way to calculate your tire pressure is to use the
<a href = 'http://btp.frame38.com'>companion web app</a>, which uses this package.</p>
    <p>To calculate your tire pressures execute this code sequence:<pre>my_bike &lt;- bike_tire_pressures() # Supply your values for the parameters
plot_bike_inflation(bike = my_bike)
</pre></p>
    <p>If a test ride indicates that the tire pressure is really too low, it&#39;s
likely your pressure gauge is reading too high. Try increasing your
pressure by 10psi.  Remember this is not an exact science nor setting so
some experimentation may be needed.</p>
    <p>Extra light casings need an extra 10-15% pressure to prevent the casing
threads from breaking.</p>
    <p>Let&#39;s say your trials indicate a performance improvement and you&#39;d like to
<a href = 'https://janheine.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/choosing-your-tires/'>explore other tire options</a>,
or it&#39;s simply time for new tires. A wider tire is a great option to
<a href = 'https://janheine.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/how-wide-a-tire-can-i-run/'>consider</a>.
The following code compares 2 setups and builds upon the first example.<pre>new_tires &lt;- bike_tire_pressures() # Supply new tires for the parameters
plot_2_bike_inflation(bike_a = my_bike, bike_b = new_tires)
</pre></p>
    <p>There are 2 cases for the load which need to be handled manually. The first
is weight carried on the rider. For example, if your bike lock is carried
on you, it should be added to the rider weight parameter, not the load
parameter. Same for a backpack.</p>
    <p>The second is a load on both the front and rear racks. It&#39;s unwise to
assume a front/rear weight distribution. My recommendation is to measure
the distribution on a level surface.  A bathroom scale place under one
wheel and a spacer block the same height as the scale placed under the
other wheel.  Load up the bike, hop on, and have a helper steady you and
read the numbers. Flip the bike around and meaure the other wheel.  Divide
the front weight by the rear weight and use that for the
<code>front_distribution</code> parameter.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="pump-inaccuracies"><a class="anchor" href="#pump-inaccuracies"></a>Pump Inaccuracies</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>Pump gauges considerably inaccurate. Parallex viewing makes precise reading
of needle impossible. Never mind the pressure sensing mechanism has a wide
tolerance.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="rim-widths"><a class="anchor" href="#rim-widths"></a>Rim Widths</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>The original research was conducted when internal widths for road rims were
around 19mm. Today&#39;s rims are available in wider sizes, 23 - 25mm,
increasing the volume up to 33%. This program does not use internal rim
width in its calculations.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="weight-vs-load"><a class="anchor" href="#weight-vs-load"></a>Weight vs. Load</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>At the end of the day, these two are effectively the same.  That said,
<em>Weight</em> is used for the individual components that go into the
calculations. <em>Load</em> is used to describe the forces the tires are
subject to.</p>
