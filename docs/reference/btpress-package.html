    <p>A program to calculate optimized bicycle tire pressure based on research that
found a small sag or droop in the profile of the tire lead to better
performance and comfort.</p>
    

        
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>Imagine that you could ride one gear faster or feel less fatigued at the end of
your ride and it cost you nothing. Tuning your bike tire pressure to you, your
bike, and your load may do just that. It all depends on wider bike tires with
flexible sidewalls.</p>
<p>Riding one gear higher, depending on your gearing, is a 5 - 8% increase.
There are now 2 independent studies that support lower pressures are
significantly better than pumping up your tires until they are rock hard. See
the References section for articles.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="directions-for-use"><a class="anchor" href="#directions-for-use"></a>Directions for Use</h2>

    
    <p>The first step is evaluating whether your tires have flexible sidewalls
which will respond readily to tire pressure changes. Tires marketed as
racing tires, marketed as having a casing from a tubular tire, used by
professional racers, or are a folding tire are good candidates. On the
other hand, puncture resistant tires,
<a href='https://edsasslercoaching.com/product-reviews/nokian-a10-studded-winter-tires/'>snow tires</a>,
and thick touring tires are supported by their sidewalls and do not
respond to pressure changes very well.</p>
<p>The simplest way to calculate your tire pressure is to use the
<a href='http://btp.frame38.com'>companion web app</a>, which uses this package.</p>
<p>To calculate your tire pressures execute this code sequence:</p><pre>my_bike &lt;- bike_tire_pressures() # Supply your values for the parameters
plot_bike_inflation(bike = my_bike)
</pre>
    <p>If a test ride indicates that the tire pressure is really too low, it's
likely your pressure gauge is reading too high. Try increasing your
pressure by 10psi.  Remember this is not an exact science nor setting so
some experimentation may be needed.</p>
<p>Extra light casings need an extra 10-15% pressure to prevent the casing
threads from breaking.</p>
<p>Let's say your trials indicate a performance improvement and you'd like to
<a href='https://janheine.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/choosing-your-tires/'>explore other tire options</a>,
or it's simply time for new tires. A wider tire is a great option to
<a href='https://janheine.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/how-wide-a-tire-can-i-run/'>consider</a>.
The following code compares 2 setups and builds upon the first example.</p><pre>new_tires &lt;- bike_tire_pressures() # Supply new tires for the parameters
plot_2_bike_inflation(bike_a = my_bike, bike_b = new_tires)
</pre>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="choosing-between-bike-and-load-weights"><a class="anchor" href="#choosing-between-bike-and-load-weights"></a>Choosing Between Bike and Load Weights</h2>

    
    <p>Bikes are for transporting stuff around, but where your stuff is attached
will impact bike handling. Increasing load weight decreases handling
stability. While your bike weight remains constant, your cargo weight could
vary from 0 to 20lbs and that will change tire pressure quite a bit.</p>
<p>Calculating how your load is distributed between both wheels depends on
factors unique to each bike that it is best to measure them.  We can
generalize about standard configurations and the following example will
highlight the limitations.</p>
<p>Example coming soon!</p>
<p>If the rider is carrying a bike lock or backpack,
their weight should be added to the rider weight, not the load weight.</p>
<p>It's unwise to assume a front/rear weight distribution when there are loads
on both the front and rear racks.  My recommendation is to measure the
distribution on a level surface.  A bathroom scale placed under one wheel
and a spacer block the same height as the scale placed under the other
wheel.  Load up the bike, hop on, and have a helper steady you and read the
numbers. Flip the bike around and measure the other wheel.  Divide the front
weight by the rear weight and use that for the <code>front_distribution</code>
parameter.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="rim-widths"><a class="anchor" href="#rim-widths"></a>Rim Widths</h2>

    
    <p>The original research was conducted when internal widths for road rims were
around 19mm. Today's rims are available in wider sizes, 23 - 25mm,
increasing the volume up to 33%. This program does not use internal rim
width in its calculations.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="pump-gauge-inaccuracies-simple"><a class="anchor" href="#pump-gauge-inaccuracies-simple"></a>Pump Gauge Inaccuracies - Simple</h2>

    
    <p>Built-in pump gauges are inaccurate. Between a wide tolerance range of the
pressure sensing mechanism and imprecise reading of the gauge needle due to
parallex, the indicated pressure should be considered an approximation.</p>
<p>A simple experiment can help determine how your pump is reading.  Inflate
your tires to the calculated pressure plus another 15psi.  If a test ride
seems harsher or your bike bounces around more, the pressure is too high.
Repeat, but this time inflate to 15psi less than the calculated pressure.
If your wheels bottom out or the handling is squishy, the pressure is too
low.  Adjust in increments of 5psi and repeat until satisfied.</p>

    <p>At the end of the day, these two are effectively the same.  That said,
<em>Weight</em> is used for the individual components that go into the
calculations. <em>Load</em> is used to describe the forces the tires are
subject to.</p>
